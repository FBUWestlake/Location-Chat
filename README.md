# Location-Chat

**Short description of your app**

Our android app builds automatic messenger groups based on a user's location and interests. These location specific chat groups make it convenient to meet new people with similar interests. 

It is easy to ask for recommendations in an area through a casual chat-based setting without the more serious commitment of a forum. 

**Required (core) user stories for your app in a bulleted list**

* Users are automatically added to the top 3 chat groups in an area. This helps people new to an area get location-based suggestions that would help encourage in-person meetings. 

* Users also leave groups automatically when they leave a location. This helps reduce the problem of having too many notifications. 

* Users can pick their own personal top 5 interests and join those chat groups. The limited number of groups helps prevent spam. 

* Users can leave a group and choose new interests at any time.
